                <h1>Oakridge Real Estate</h1>
                <p>As a full-time graphic designer, I was able to shape the way this brand expanded and developed.<br>When I started, the had recently rebranded.
                They had a logo suite, color palette, and typography, but when it came to marketing materials, it was all very templated. I found ways to use design elements in their brand to expand brand recognition and through this,
            the community began to recognize Oakridge without even seeing a logo.</p>

<section class="oakridge-expand">
    <p>To expand brand recognition, I wanted to get Oakridge's audience familiar with specific elements of their brand. How? <b>Glad you asked... using identifying brand elements!</b><br>
    Their primary colors are navy blue and green, but in their marketing, their green color was not utilized much, and you only saw the color within the leaf in their logo. I began implementing more of this primary color in their marketing collateral.
I started to take the leaf from the logo and use it anywhere I could. It's a major visual identifier, and I never saw it anywhere besides in the logo itself! Now, that leaf is a major recognition piece for the brand.
Their brand typography consisted of a bold serif font and two sans serifs. Having three typefaces that are fairly similar to one another does not give us contrast or weight variations in our designs!
I implemented Turbinado, a stylized script font that contrasts nicely to the other current fonts. This became the default font to place their tagline in, "#1 in the Cedar Valley" which you can see more of in the social media section.</p>
