</div>
    <div class="heather-info">
    <h2>Actually, I'm Heather! I'm a freelance graphic designer.</h2>
        <p>I graduated at the elderly age of 30 with my BFA in graphic design & media arts. I studied everything from graphic design, web design, illustration, game art, animation, and marketing.
            I'm currently based in the Midwest (inspiration capital of the world) but I work with clients all over the map. I have a certification in being a silly goose, and love having fun throughout the design process with my clients.

        <h3>I started freelancing because I understand the feeling...</h3>
        <p>Strategic & intentional design can grow your business and help you ditch the "let's see if this works" mentality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I understand the feeling of sending my website to a client, hoping it works & converts to a sale.</li>
            <li>I understand the rush of quick and easy templated logo, to feel bored with it a month later.</li>
            <li>I understand randomly posting on social media, hoping an interested client connects with me.</li>
            <li>Throwing things at the wall and hoping it sticks is not a marketing & design strategy!</li>
        </ul>
